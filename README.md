# 🎯 Image Recognition Model Deployment 🚀

Welcome to **Image Recognition Model Deployment** – where AI meets production in a seamless, scalable way! 🤖⚡

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🐍 **Python** – The powerhouse language! 💪
- 🐳 **Docker** – For smooth containerized deployment! 🏗️
- 🌎 **Flask** – Making our model accessible via API! 🎯
- 🔍 **Image Recognition** – Because AI needs to *see*! 👀
- 📜 **Logging & Monitoring** – Stay informed, stay in control! 📊

## 🎬 Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get your model up and running! 🏎️💨

### 1️⃣ Clone the repo 🛎️

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/yvesdylane/Deploying-an-Image-Recognition-Model-to-a-Local-Production-Environment-Objective 
 cd Deploying-an-Image-Recognition-Model-to-a-Local-Production-Environment-Objective
```

### 2️⃣ Build & Run with Docker 🐳

```bash
 docker build -t image-recognition .
 docker run -p 8080:8080 image-recognition
```

Your API should now be running at **http\://localhost:8080** 🚀

### 3️⃣ Test the API 📡

Use Postman or curl to send an image for prediction:

```bash
 curl -X POST -F "file=@image.jpg" http://localhost:8080/predict
```

And BOOM 💥! You'll get the AI's prediction! 🧠📸
