## 🎬 Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get your model up and running! 🏎️💨

### 1️⃣ Clone the repo 🛎️

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yvesdylane/Deploying-an-Image-Recognition-Model-to-a-Local-Production-Environment-Objective 
cd Deploying-an-Image-Recognition-Model-to-a-Local-Production-Environment-Objective

### 2️⃣ Build & Run with Docker 🐳

```bash
 docker build -t image-recognition .
 docker run -p 8080:8080 image-recognition
```

Your API should now be running at **http\://localhost:8080** 🚀

### 3️⃣ Test the API 📡

Use Postman or curl to send an image for prediction:

```bash
 curl -X POST -F "file=@image.jpg" http://localhost:8080/predict
```

And BOOM 💥! You'll get the AI's prediction! 🧠📸

### 4️⃣ Try the Web Interface 🖼️

For those who prefer a graphical interface, we’ve got you covered! 🎉 The web interface allows you to upload images and see predictions in real-time. Here’s how it looks:

To use the web interface:

- Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080.

- Click the Upload Image button.

- Select an image from your device.

- Watch as the model predicts the class of the image! 🎉
